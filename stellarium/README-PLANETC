|     A powerful user interface for Stellarium      |
|___________________________________________________|


Planetarium Control, or PlanetC for short, allows easy control of
almost all Stellarium functionalities through a powerful and
intuituive graphical user interface. Its main purpose is to help
lecturers and operators to show astronomical phenomena using the
Stellarium simulation software, either projected on a screen or on a
planetarium dome. A preliminary documentation on PlanetC can be found
at:
   https://github.com/gcalderone/PlanetC/wiki

The source code can be downloaded from:
   https://github.com/gcalderone/PlanetC

PlanetC has the same dependencies and compilation procedure of
Stellarium: once you are able to compile the original Stellarium code,
you can compile PlanetC without any additional effort.

PlanetC is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GPL (see the LICENSE file for more details).

If you like PlanetC, and wish to support its development, please
consider making a donation to Giorgio Calderone
(https://paypal.me/planetc). Even a small amount will be highly
appreciated. 
Also please star our repository on Github!  ;-)
