**The first public release of PlanetC is scheduled for March 13th, 2016**

Planetarium Control, or **PlanetC** for short, allows easy control of (almost) all [Stellarium](http://stellarium.org/) functionalities through a powerful and intuitive graphical user interface.  Its main purpose is to help lecturers and operators to show astronomical phenomena using the Stellarium simulation software, using either a screen projector or a planetarium dome.

The documentation on **PlanetC** can be found in the [wiki pages](https://github.com/gcalderone/PlanetC/wiki).


**PlanetC** main features are:

- an easy-to-use graphical user interface shown on a separate window with respect to the main Stellarium window;
- extensive control over (almost) all Stellarium functionalities;
- a "live" image to check in real time what's being shown on the main Stellarium window;
- constellation art are shown in different (customizable) colors;
- script handling (start, pause, stop);
- show movies and images;
- an enhanced auto zoom/unzoom facility;
- a general state set/restore facility to easily handle global Stellarium state in scripts;
- customizable list of "quick" object selection buttons;
- customized date, time, location and cardinal points display, specifically designed for use in planetarium dome;
- ability to clone and rotate movies and images, to be displayed as twin pictures in planetarium domes;

All **PlanetC** operations are performed in its own window, without influencing the main Stellarium view, allowing the operators to properly control Stellarium while the audience focuses on the sky simulation.

**PlanetC** currently relies on a modified version of the original Stellarium code, and has the same dependencies and compilation procedure of Stellarium: once you are able to compile the original Stellarium code, you can compile **PlanetC** without any additional effort.

**PlanetC** has been developed by the [Star Freedom association](http://www.starfreedom.it/), a non-profit association involved in science lecturing and astronomy activities in south Italy.  The Star Freedom operators successfully employed **PlanetC** as main control software in many hundreds shows performed within their planetarium.

**PlanetC** is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GPL (see the LICENSE file for more details).
