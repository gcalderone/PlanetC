# PlanetC
*A user interface for Stellarium, specifically designed for planetarium control.*

Planetarium Control, or **PlanetC** for short, is a nice, friendly and powerful user interface to control [Stellarium](http://stellarium.org/).  It has been specifically designed to be used in planetarium systems, but it can also be in any situation you wish to easily control the Stellarium functionalities.

The **PlanetC** interface is designed as a plugin for Stellarium, however it requires a few teaks in the original Stellarium code.  Hence we provide both the Stellarium modified code and PlanetC code in a single package.
We plan to deploy new releases of **PlanetC** within a few weeks from each Stellarium release.
**PlanetC** has the same dependencies and compilation procedure of Stellarium, hence once you are able to compile the original Stellarium code, you are able to compile **PlanetC** without any additional effort.
