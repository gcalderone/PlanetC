# PlanetC
*A user interface for Stellarium, specifically designed for planetarium control.*

** WORK IN PROGRESS: THE PlanetC REPOSITORY IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION **

Planetarium Control, or **PlanetC** for short, is a friendly and powerful user interface which allows easy control of all [Stellarium](http://stellarium.org/) functionalities, and provides a few more features.  Its main purpose is to be used in planetarium systems, but it's also well suited to work in any situation you wish to easily control Stellarium.

A preliminary documentation can be found in the [wiki pages](https://github.com/gcalderone/PlanetC/wiki).

The development of the **PlanetC** interface required a few tweaks in the original Stellarium code, hence we provide both the Stellarium modified code and the PlanetC code in a single package. We plan to deploy new releases of **PlanetC** within a few weeks after each Stellarium release.  **PlanetC** has the same dependencies and compilation procedure of Stellarium: once you are able to compile the original Stellarium code, you can compile **PlanetC** without any additional effort.

**PlanetC** has been developed in close collaboration with [Star Freedom](http://www.starfreedom.it/), a non-profit association involved in science lecturing and astronomy activities in several schools of south Italy.  The Star freedom  operators successfully employed **PlanetC** as main planetarium software in many hundreds shows performed within their travelling planetarium.

**PlanetC** is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GPL (see the LICENSE file for more details).
