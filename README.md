# PlanetC
*A user interface for Stellarium, specifically designed for planetarium control.*

Planetarium Control, or **PlanetC** for short, is a friendly and powerful user interface to control [Stellarium](http://stellarium.org/).  It has been specifically designed to be used in planetarium systems, but it can also be used in any situation you wish to easily control the Stellarium functionalities.

The development of the **PlanetC** interface required a few teaks in the original Stellarium code, hence we provide both the Stellarium modified code and the PlanetC code in a single package.
We plan to deploy new releases of **PlanetC** within a few weeks after each Stellarium release.
**PlanetC** has the same dependencies and compilation procedure of Stellarium: once you are able to compile the original Stellarium code, you are able to compile **PlanetC** without any additional effort.

**PlanetC** has been developed in close collaboration with [Star Freedom](http://www.starfreedom.it/), a non-profit association involved in science lecturing and astronomy activities in several schools of south Italy.  The Star freedom  operators successfully employed **PlanetC** as main planetarium software in many hundreds shows performed within their travelling planetarium.

**PlanetC** is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GPL (see the LICENSE file for more details).
